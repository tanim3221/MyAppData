Hope you are well and safe.

I have some concerns and confusion regarding the leave deduction criteria and policies. Kindly assist in clarifying these matters.

Issue 01: Qualification for Deduction Criteria with One Day approved extra leave
Could you please provide information on the qualification criteria for availing a deduction with one day of approved extra leave?

Issue 02: Leave Application Approval and Deduction Query
I noticed that my leave application for the professional-level examination was approved by Principal Sir. Additionally, I have sufficient leave balance in the BCS leave portal. However, Could you please explain why my allowance deducts for one day of approved extra leave without prior notification?

Issue 03: "Leave Without Pay" and “Leave Encashment” Policy for Articled Students
I am not sure whether the "leave without pay" and “Leave Encashment” policy applies to articled students. Could you kindly confirm if this policy is available for us?

Thank you for your attention to these matters. I have attached the relevant documents for your reference.

Enclosed:
01. Leave application approval from Principal Sir.
02. Leave Balance status from BCS Leave Portal
03. The last exam leave application in the BCS Leave portal
04. Allowance Calculation for the month of July 23
