Hope you are well and safe.

I am writing to you today to clarify some concerns I have about the leave deduction criteria and policies.

Issue 1: Qualification for Deduction Criteria with One Day Approved Extra Leave

I would like to know the qualification criteria for availing a deduction with one day of approved extra leave.

Issue 2: Leave Application Approval and Deduction Query

I noticed that my leave application for the professional-level examination was approved by Principal Sir. I also have sufficient leave balance in the BCS leave portal. However, I am confused as to why my allowance was deducted for one day of approved extra leave without prior notification.

Issue 3: "Leave Without Pay" and “Leave Encashment” Policy for Articled Students

I am unsure whether the "leave without pay" and “Leave Encashment” policy applies to articled students. Could you kindly confirm if this policy is available to us?

Thank you for your attention to these matters. I have attached the relevant documents for your reference.

Enclosed:

Leave application approval from Principal Sir.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
